Your business just started or has been up and running for a little bit. But customers can't find you.

One great marketing tool, whether you have a website or not, is a [Facebook business page](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-page-basics){:target="_blank"}.

According to [Katie Sehl on Hootsuite](https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-demographics/){:target="_blank"}, there are over 2 billion active users each month on Facebook and they are probably in your target market.

**But a Facebook page is not ideal for every business.** Your target market may be active on other social media platforms or may not be very active online. So how do you know if it's right for your business? 

**Read on to see if these 5 reasons apply** and you should create a Facebook page for your business.

## 1. You Need a Basic Informational Page
**Maybe you don't have a website yet, but need to be online.**

Facebook pages allow you to advertise your business (name, location, hours, details, etc) for ***FREE***. It's a great way to get your name out there. You get an online presence without the [additional costs associated with a website](https://staciefarmer.com/3-Reasons-You-Dont-Need-A-Website/).

**Maybe you have a website too.** Great! Direct potential customers to your website from your Facebook page. [Andrea Vahl on Social Media Examiner](https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/drive-more-facebook-traffic/){:target="_blank"} has some great tips on optimizing your Facebook page for SEO (*Search Engine Optimization*) and for guiding users to your website (*see Tip #4*).

Website or no website, creating a Facebook business page is a **great way to grow your online presence and bring in more customers**.

## 2. Connect With Your Local Community
If you're a local business, Facebook is a great way to connect and be visible in your community.

Users can comment on your page or posts, ask questions, and leave reviews. These interactions, and how you respond, can **build trust and establish a long-term relationship with your customers**.

Travis Balinas at Outbound Engine has some [great tips on Social Media Etiquette for Businesses](https://www.outboundengine.com/blog/social-media-etiquette-for-business-25-dos-donts/){:target="_blank"}. You will treat online customers as courteously and respectfully as you do other customers. But there are additional factors that arise online. I highly recommend reading the article to help you navigate as a business online.

Facebook pages are **a valuable marketing opportunity for increasing visibility in your local community**. Be authentic, kind, and respectful and clients will come to you for solutions first.

## 3. Share Photos, Videos, & Events
Facebook is all about sharing. 

**If you're a visually aesthetic business, like a caterer or photographer, you can share high-quality photos of your work.** Draw their eye and show customers what you can do for them. The more appealing the picture, the more shares you're likely to get.

Maybe video works best for your business. Invest in a high-quality video and let your personality shine.

If your company hosts events, Facebook is a **great platform for allowing people to RSVP and share the event with their friends.**

No matter what method of promotion works best for you, Facebook can help you reach your target audience and display your talents.

## 4. Promote items, run contests or giveaways
Does your business sell products? **Use Facebook to share new or interesting items with  customers.** Take a high-quality photo and tell customers why this new product is perfect for them. 

Even better, **offer a giveaway or run a contest!**

Emily Weisberg on ThriveHive offers some [great tips for running a Facebook contest](https://thrivehive.com/how-to-run-a-facebook-contest/){:target="_blank"}. There are rules you must follow so I also recommend reviewing Rafflecopter's post on [Facebook Promotion Guidelines](https://www.rafflecopter.com/facebook-promotion-guidelines){:target="_blank"}.

Give them a read and **start creating buzz about your products!**

## 5. You Enjoy Connecting & Interacting With Customers
Facebook is all about connection. It will enhance your interactions with customers more than a website ever could.

This level of interaction requires time and commitment. **Most users expect a response to their posts within *24 hours*.** If you can't do that, tell users when to expect a response in your 'About' section and stick to it! 

Most importantly, **be gracious and kind when responding**. Most users review a business when they're delighted or pissed off. Sometimes it's not fun, but showing a customer you care about their experience, good or bad, can do wonders to build customer loyalty. 

Another fun thing about Facebook, **you can ask customers questions**. Run a poll and ask people their favorite flavor of ice cream at your shop. Ask what books they're planning to read over summer break. Ask about things that relate to your services and engage your customer's interest.

Don't try to make a sale. Be curious about customer's lives, interests, and pain points. Build trust between you and your customers. Nurture that relationship so you can help them for many years to come.
