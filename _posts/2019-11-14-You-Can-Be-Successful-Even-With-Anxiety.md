title: You Can Be Successful - Even With Anxiety
categories: [Small-Business, Musings]
description: Looking online for help with my anxiety, I found many people suggesting I should just give up now. I couldn't be a business owner with anxiety. I'm calling bullshit and I think anyone can be successful in any role - even with anxiety.

I've dealt with anxiety for most of my life. Any time I pursue a particularly difficult goal - like starting a business - my anxiety flares up.

This happened just last week. I was working on my business plan and I started panicking. 

- What if I put in all this work and no one wants it?
- What if I can't learn what I need to learn?
- Am I wasting my time?

So I did what anyone does nowadays - I looked online for answers.

## The Internet Doesn't Know All
A few opinions were helpful and had strategies for handling fear and anxiety. Others were not so helpful. More than a few said something along the lines of, "If you're feeling anxious or worried, you're not cut out to run a business. You should just quit now." So helpful - right?

I'm a woman in tech. I've dealt with a lot of bullshit and have been told similar ideas like the one above:

- If you don't get it, maybe you're not cut out to be a developer
- If you can't deal with the teasing (*belittling*), maybe you're in the wrong field
- If you don't have the desire to code every waking hour, maybe development isn't right for you

They didn't say it in those exact terms, but it was definitely implied. If you feel this way, just get out now because the system won't change and you can't either.

**It's narrow-minded, demeaning, and just plain wrong.**

## Success Is Complex

Success is not a step-by-step plan. Do this, then that, then bam! You're successful.

It's way more complicated than that. Success is not guaranteed. **Everyone bring a different set of skills and they can succeed, or not, in different ways.**

Having anxiety doesn't guarantee failure. Does it guarantee struggle? Absolutely, but everyone struggles. We each have unique challenges and our own way of dealing with them.

## Practice Makes Better

My anxiety causes me to struggle with:

- indecision
- solving this particular problem before moving on
- ruminating on possible negative outcomes

It can make it difficult to run a business. **Luckily, dealing with anxiety is a skill. Any skill improves with practice.**

I practice dealing with my anxiety every single day by:

- getting enough sleep, exercise, and nutritious food
- balancing work with relaxing activities
- taking things at my own pace
- meditating to focus on the present

These skills work for me because my anxiety is unique to my situation. What I do won't work for everyone, but that's not the point. 

**The point is to develop skills to cope with your anxiety - ones that work for you - and practice them.** We all have challenges, but practicing our own positive coping strategies keeps them in check. It also improves our confidence and other areas of our life. Win, win, win.

## Anxiety As An Asset

Anxiety can have benefits too. 

My personal brand of anxiety enables me to:

- think before acting
- research and develop a plan
- focus on long-term outcomes
- avoid unnecessary risks

My anxiety often shows up because of fear. I'm worried something bad will happen. So I try to control the situation. I plan, think about the long-term, and develop strategies to minimize or reduce risk. That's a benefit to my business.

I'm less likely to waste money and I'm more likely to stay in business. It's not guaranteed, but **my anxiety encourages me to think before I act and improves the likelihood of success**.

## Everyone Has Unique Skills To Offer

There isn't a guaranteed path to success. And there's no right set of skills that will get you there. 

**Everything you bring to the table will both help, and hurt, you.** That's okay.

Recognize your struggles bring benefits and challenges. Acknowledge the challenges and develop skills to cope. 

**But success can be achieved - even with anxiety.**

And remember, if you're looking for advice on the internet - take it with a grain of salt. Most of us have no idea what we're talking about.
