title: 3 Reasons You Don't Need A Website
---

Every business has a website now or so it seems. You figure your business needs one too. But maybe not.

Every business needs **an online presence**.
But not every business needs a *website*.

Here are 3 reasons you probably don't need one.

<!--more-->

### 1. You don't have the money

Websites are expensive (if done well). A fully-customized website can cost a couple thousand dollars. An out-of-the-box site will run you at least $300+ a year. 

Can you pay to have your website built the right way?

Building a website is like building a house. You get what you pay for. Upgrade the bathroom - extra cost. Make a design change late in the process - extra cost. The bigger or more custom your website, the more time, money, and stress.

You can keep your website small and simple. You'll keep costs down and launch your website sooner. You still need to know exactly what you want for your website and share your vision with the developer. 

### 2. You don't have the time

**Websites are time-consuming**. A developer (or you) builds them, which can take a few weeks to a few months. With a developer, you have to be available to provide direction, files, content, and anything else they need. 

**Building a website is stressful**. Like building a house, you'll need to make many decisions.

Once your website's built, you'll need to [keep it updated](https://staciefarmer.com/One-Easy-Way-To-Keep-Your-Website-Secure/). You'll add new content, make changes, and keep software up to date. Do you have the time, money, and knowledge to update it? 

Owning a website is like owning a house. Once you've built it, you must maintain it. Do you have the resources for it?

### 3. Everyone else is doing it

You don't want to be left behind. I get it. 

As we've covered in #1 and #2, you don't have the time or money for it right now. What may work for your competitor may not work for you. And that's okay.

You can focus on building your business and when it's the right time, you'll know it.

## But I Still Need to be Online!

Agreed. If these things apply to you - **you don't need a website**.

But *every business needs an online presence*.

You need to decide - **what do you want to achieve with your online presence?**

- Do you need people to find you?
- Do you want to market to interested customers?
- Do you want to sell products online?
- Do you want to showcase your products, but still sell them in person?

You can achieve these goals without a website. 

You can use Facebook, Google My Business, Yelp, Etsy, Amazon, Instagram, or loads of different services. You'll accomplish your goals and spend less time and money doing it.

## Wrap It Up
You don't have the time or money, but see every other business has a website. Don't do it!
