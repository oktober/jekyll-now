My daughter can sit and draw for hours.

As a kid, I would play whatever I wanted on the piano for hours.

At some point, we’re forced into adulthood. Our worth becomes less about who we are and more about what and how much we produce.

Since entering adulthood, my creativity has been plagued by doubt. 
Will they like what I wrote?
Will anyone read it?
Will it be useful?

Instead of being a creative outlet, writing has become another way to measure my “productivity”.

I get it. Work is a vital part of capitalism. But so is our humanity.

Where are the spaces for uninhibited creativity? Where and when can I write because I want to, not because I have to? Where can my daughter draw whatever she wants without justifying her time? Where can we be free to explore and learn and create?

Honestly, I haven’t found that place - yet. But I’m still looking.

These creative safe spaces are essential to childhood and adulthood. Each of us has something to say. We need a medium and a space to say it, free from fear and doubt.

But maybe these creative safe spaces aren’t physical spaces, but mental ones.

If I sit and write just for me, everyone else’s expectations fade away. My sentence structure may be suboptimal, but I know what I’m saying. It’s good enough. The simple fact that I get to say it, and share it if I want, is enough.

I like that mental state. I want to nurture it and make it a safe haven where I can create and express myself. Because though I am flawed, I deserve to be heard. I deserve to create and leave my unique mark on this world. Everyone does.
