# Jumping back in

Hello world, it's nice to be back.

I took a short hiatus from programming while I earned my Bachelor's degree in Business - IT Management. It was awesome getting back into school and learning about a whole new field. I discovered my passion for economics and all things business. This newfound passion is a perfect pairing for my background in technology.

I also moved my family from Utah to Washington which was a fun adventure. Things have been hectic lately, but are starting to slow down. 

I'm hoping to experiment with this site. I'm learning how to use Jekyll as a static site generator. I'm jumping back into programming in general. I'm also dipping my toe into the world of security with the help of a good friend.

This site will, hopefully, be a place where I can share some tidbits of what I'm learning. Partly to help others, and partly to help cement the knowledge I'm learning and improve my communication skills. We can all use a bit of help there.

So thanks for having me back and let's see where this goes!
