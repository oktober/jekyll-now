title: Have Fun and Break Shit

description: Don't you want to rediscover the curiosity and wonder you had as a kid? Find it by letting loose and breaking some shit.

Life is complicated. It's stressful and only gets worse each day.

So have some fun instead - break some shit.

<!--more-->

I don't mean take a hammer to your bathroom, unless you were planning a demo job anyway. I don't even mean breaking with an aim to destroy. 

More like breaking to discover. Do it and see what else you discover. Granted, I'm thinking specifically about breaking software, but you could apply this to other domains if you'd like.

Back to the software....pick an app you use. Try something a little different than what it expects. Enter random characters. Try a different path. **What happens if...** Follow that thought and see where it leads.

Not every little thing we do has to be serious. If it is, our curiosity and wonder dies. Life becomes boring. We stop learning. We stop growing. It's quite depressing if you think about it.

So let loose. Have fun. Break some shit.

You'll learn loads about whatever app or tool you're using. You might find a bug that needs to be fixed. Maybe you find everything works exactly as it's supposed to do - but I doubt it.

No matter what you find, it's fun. And we all need a little more fun in our lives. 

So indulge your curiosity and **go break some shit**.
