description: Just because I have depression, why must I constantly feel not good "enough"? Why can't how I am, awful feelings and all, be right? Can I accept myself for who I am, right at this moment?

Winter gives me a feeling of malaise. The snow confines me to my home. The freezing temperatures force me to my bed in search of warmth. It’s isolating. Winter leaves me alone with only my thoughts. I don’t do well with that.

But eventually spring beings to arrive. The sun rises a little earlier each day and sets a little later. The birds begin to sing and life begins to return. I feel a renewed sense of hope. Maybe life can be good again. Maybe I can feel good again.

This is a deceitful thought. Because somewhere inside me, I believe I can force myself to feel good. If I change enough of my life, I can change who I am. I can run away from myself and discover there was someone else hidden inside. All I need is that one, magical change to bring her out.

This is a lie. A convincing one, but a lie nonetheless. Believe me, I’ve tried. I’ve tried to change my life. I’ve changed it in subtle ways like getting a new hairstyle or rearranging the furniture. I’ve changed it in big ways like finding a new place to live, switching careers, or leaving a marriage. 

And it’s never worked. Not once. 

No matter how far I’ve run, I’m still the same person. My malaise follows me like a shadow. I can hide for a while, but it always comes back.

I’m tired of running. I’m tired of putting all my energy into changing my life only to have it all end up the same. I’m tired of falling into depression after depression when nothing ever changes. I’m tired of repeating the same cycle over and over and over again.

I’m tired. And I’m willing to believe that maybe I’ve gone about this the wrong way.

Maybe happiness isn’t a goal. The self help enterprise would have you believe otherwise, but maybe they’re wrong. 

Maybe the goal is acceptance. 

What if I could accept my life will always be tinged with a hint of depression? What if sometimes it gets really bad, but mostly it just makes for a lot of shitty days? What if I’m right, not good nor great but right, exactly the way I am?

That’s a crazy thought. I’ve spent my entire life trying to change who I am. Everybody tells me how wrong I am and since I feel pretty miserable most of the time, I assumed they were right. But were they?

What if I was born with this predisposition, but it doesn’t make me wrong? What if it’s a struggle I’ll always have, but one I can handle? What if I don’t have to change who I am, but can accept myself?

It sounds quite nice, actually. Thinking that feels like I’ve been holding my breath and can finally let it out. It’s a relief.

I’ll still have challenges and struggles. Self-care will always be a priority for me to just get by. But it doesn’t have to be a battle against who I am. It can be a gift. And it might work most days, but some days it might not. I can accept that as well.

Some days I’ll even feel happy, even if it’s fleeting. I can have moments where the sunset will take my breath away or my kids will fill me with such love I think it’s going to overpower me. 

And then I’ll probably go back to my baseline. And that’s okay.

I’m tired. I’m tired of running from who I am and forcing myself to fit someone else’s narrative. I’d rather create my own. In it, I can be good enough exactly as I am. I can accept the awful bits of me as well as the amazing ones. Because that’s how we all are - beautiful and ugly, kind and mean, loving and hurtful. Being human means being a big mess of contradictions. And I love it.
