title: Looking For a Simple Cybersecurity Solution? Run Regular Backups

description: Do you just want to do the bare minimum to protect yourself from online attacks? If there's one thing you need to do, it's this.

Nobody wants their devices to be compromised. But it will happen. To all of us. It’s really just a matter of time.

Anyone with an internet connection is “connected” to you, in the broadest sense, right now. Attackers are trying to gain access and/or infect your devices 24/7. Maybe not you specifically, but all of us collectively.

**Attacks will happen.** But we can minimize the damage. And we can make our lives a little bit easier after the fact.

## By Running Regular Backups

It seems like such a silly little thing. Of course a backup will help.

But how often do you backup your files?

Smartphones and tablets are easier. They don't hold as much data so we can use a free backup service. If you have Apple products, you just set it to automatically backup to iCloud each night.

Computers (and servers/databases) are a bit trickier. 

They have way more data. They take more space. So it costs more and needs to be done fairly often.

**Good businesses have an automated backup process.** It’s set to run at a certain time. It backs up automatically so no one has to worry about it.

Can you do that for your computer?

## Automating Backups

There are cloud services which will run automatically. Or maybe you just store everything in Dropbox. That’s great, if you’re using encryption (which of course you are, right?)

I’ll admit, I’m not the best at this. I have physical drives that I backup my encrypted files on. I have a schedule for when I backup different things. But it’s all manual.

That makes it hard. It also makes it more likely that I’ll miss a backup. I need to do better.

[**TimeMachine for Macs**](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250){:target="_blank"} will run automatic backups and comes preinstalled.  **Many backup apps are available for [Linux](https://www.ubuntupit.com/top-15-free-open-source-backup-software-for-linux/){:target="_blank"} and [Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/free-backup-software-tools-2617964){:target="_blank"}** that work the same way. It’s simply a matter of doing your research and picking one that will work for you. 

Once you pick your software, you’ll need to have an **encrypted, external storage device connected**. You’ll set a schedule for how often to run a back up. And you’ll want this to be convenient for you. ***If it’s not convenient, you won’t do it.***

If you’re like me with a manual backup process, or even no process at all, then this is a great place to do some research. ***There isn't one right way to do it.*** Your needs are different than mine. Mine are different than my neighbor’s. 

So get out there and look around. Find something you like that you can do regularly and will keep your backups fairly secure.

Then, when your device(s) are infected with ransomware or you were just [one of the unlucky people who ran a major (but flawed) update](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/10/patch-tuesday-october-2018-edition/){:target="_blank"} - it’ll be MUCH easier to recover.

***Sometimes the simplest solutions are also the most effective.***
