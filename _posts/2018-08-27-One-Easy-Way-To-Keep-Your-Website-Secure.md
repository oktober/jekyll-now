description: There's one super easy way to keep your website secure and safe. Make sure you know what it is and how to prevent your website from getting hacked.

This one thing - you already know how to do it...for the most part.

We all know we _should_ do it.

It pops up and reminds us over and over again.

But we don't do it.

Because we're busy. Because it doesn't seem important. Because there are 20 other fires to put out right now.

But we HAVE to do it.

What is it? __Updates__.

Yes, updates are annoying.

Yes, we all hate having to do them.

And yes, they will probably save your website from getting hacked.

Updates are often for vulnerabilities that they knew about for a little while. If the company knew about it - you can guarantee a hacker (or many hackers) knew about it too.

Those hackers are cruising around the internet looking for devices with those vulnerabilities. They're looking for your old, unpatched (_'not updated'_) device right now.

__Anything connected to the internet is at risk.__
- Your POS (_'point-of-sale'_) system.
- Your website.
- The phone you take payments on.
- Your shop's security system that you can log in to remotely.

All. At. Risk.

If it can connect to the internet, **_it's at risk._**
