  <p>Hi there! I'm Stacie and I'm a full stack developer who helps companies secure their web applications.</p>
  <p>This is my little corner of the internet where I write about the things I'm learning, share talks I've given, and occasionally recommend what I think are good resources.</p>
  <p>I'm a big privacy advocate so you don't have to worry about cookies or any kind of tracking on my page. Relax, take a look around, and I hope you find something you like.</p>

  <hr>

  <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I am currently open to remote Application Security positions</span>. If you're looking for someone with experience building web applications who is also obsessed with securing them, reach out to me on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear from you!</p>
