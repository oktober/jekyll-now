Hi there! I'm Stacie and I'm a full stack developer who helps companies secure their web applications.

I've worked on the back-end building web applications from scratch or modifying an existing CMS. I'm equally comfortable taking a PSD and creating a fully functioning web page from it. I love learning more about the networks and systems we build our applications on and am currently obsessed with how we can better secure them.

If I'm not at my computer, you can find me outside in the garden. I love trying new plants, especially growing them straight from seed. I'm striving to live more off our little bit of land and get better at it each year.

I also enjoy volunteering with our local Master Gardeners association. We learn about the latest gardening methods backed by research and share those methods with the local community.

When the weather gets too cold for gardening, or my back is too sore, I can be found snuggled up inside with a cup of tea and one of the many books I'm reading.

I'd love to help a company, with a remote team, make their web application(s) more secure.

I want to find the right tools to help test your application(s) for vulnerabilities or to dive right into the code, depending on what the situation calls for. I enjoy translating the technical into something humans can understand and working with both technical and non-technical teams.

When it comes down to it, I love to always be learning and applying that knowledge to help companies and people be safer online.

If you think I could help, reach out to me on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear about you, your company, and your goals to improve your application's security.
