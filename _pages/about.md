I learn as much as I can. I code, write, and occasionally speak. When not doing these things I also read, play games, and dig in the dirt. 

I'm passionate about making tech careers accessible to everyone and believe in using tech ethically. I work to help others learn more about technology & security and believe in empowering everyday users with knowledge.
