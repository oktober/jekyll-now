Hi there, I'm Stacie! I'm a full stack developer who helps companies secure their web applications.

I've worked on the back-end, building web applications from scratch or modifying an existing CMS. I'm also comfortable on the front-end taking a PSD and creating a fully functioning web page from it. I love learning more about the networks and systems we build our applications on. I'm obsessed with how we can better secure those applications and protect our data, customers, and businesses.

If I'm not at my computer, you can find me outside in the garden. I love growing new plants from seed - both edible and ornamental. I'm learning what grows in our area and aim to grow as much of our own food as possible. Every year I get a little bit better at it.

I also enjoy volunteering with our local Master Gardeners association. We learn about the latest gardening methods backed by research and share those methods with the local community.

When the weather gets too cold for gardening, or my back is too sore, I can be found snuggled up inside with a cup of tea and one of the many books I'm reading.

I'd love to help a company, with a remote team, make their web applications more secure.

I enjoy finding the right tools to help test an application and also love diving right into the code, depending on what the situation calls for. I can translate the technical into something humans can understand and love working with both technical and non-technical teams.

When it comes down to it, I love to always be learning and applying that knowledge to help companies and people be safer online.

If you think I could help, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/staciefarmer" target="_blank">reach out to me on LinkedIn</a>. I'd love to hear about you, your company, and your goals to improve your application's security.
