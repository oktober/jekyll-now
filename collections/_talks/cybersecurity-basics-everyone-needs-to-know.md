Your accounts and personal information aren't safe. They haven’t been for a while. In 2018 alone, over 900 billion records were leaked in data breaches. That’s your information out there. 

In this talk, you’ll learn cybersecurity basics you need to know to protect your accounts, information, and devices. You’ll learn common ways individuals are attacked (such as credential stuffing, brute force, malware, etc.) and how to defend yourself. 

It’s often the simple things that allow an attack. So whether you’ve been in technology for a while or are just starting out, you’ll learn something useful to keep cybercriminals at bay.
