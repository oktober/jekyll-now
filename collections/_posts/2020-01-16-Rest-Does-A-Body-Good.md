I struggle with rest.

I know breaks are good. I know I need them. Sometimes I have to take them because I get sick - physically or mentally.

But even then, I fight against taking a break.

## Why Do I Do This?
My dad’s a workaholic. I think I’ve picked up some dysfunctional ideas about work from him.

Whenever I’m sick - again, physically or mentally - I don’t want to slow down. I have a pace and a schedule. Come hell or high water, I want to stick to it.

So I fight against my fatigue. I try to psyche myself up with [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/){:target="_blank"} and inspirational articles. If that doesn’t work, I’ll rest but not happily. I feel ashamed that I can’t push through it - especially if it’s a mental health break. So it's a type of rest, but not necessarily a rejuvenating one.

I have this twisted idea that I should always be in top performance condition. Every day I should be able to put out a minimum amount of work. Some days, even more. 

But these ideas are flawed.

1 - No one is ever at peak condition 100% of the time. You don't run a marathon to train for a marathon. You run a little bit less, on average, and then push yourself the day of the marathon (or so I would think. I've never ran a marathon - just a 5k. I'm just assuming the same logic applies.)

2 - My 100% is not someone else's 100%. I'm constantly comparing myself to others to figure out how much I should be doing. But I'm not them. It's not an accurate comparison and it leaves me feeling like I'm constantly not doing enough.

## My Energy Limitations
I am not a bundle of energy. Most days I struggle to get going. I exercise, but it wears me out. I, unfortunately, do not have a large amount of spare energy to burn off.

Looking at the amount of work I can do 

 So I look at the amount of work I can slog through in an average day and it never feels like enough. Probably because my role model is a workaholic and other high achievers - of which I am not.

Instead of accepting this part of me, I fight against it. I want to be like them and I’m ashamed I’m not.

But I want to stop doing this. Because it just makes me miserable and it makes my work, which I genuinely enjoy, miserable.

## Becoming My Authentic Self
I’ve been doing a lot of self-reflection and self-work lately. I’ve come to realize I make most of my decisions based on someone else’s standards - not my own.

Take my work and rest expectations.

### Past Expectations
**Work**

I will be at or near 100% every day - even weekends (but just focused on "house" work). I won't need days off. If I miss a few hours or a day, I'll make it up that week.

**Home**

I will work at peak condition, then have endless patience for my kids and overwhelming desire to cook, clean, and help with homework.

**Rest**

I will only need to rest during scheduled vacations. Even if I take my children, I will have no stresses and lots of downtime while on vacation. I will return well-rested and full of energy.

No red flags there, right?

### It's Not What I Want
If I'm being honest, these expectations - while very noble - are not even what I want. 

I don't want to be a workaholic. I want to take time off to play and enjoy myself.

I don't want to do all the house or parent things. I want to help my kids stay on top of their schoolwork, but not by me looking over their shoulder every night. I want to have home-cooked meals and a moderately clean home, but not by cooking every meal from scratch and cleaning every spare minute.

I want to have restful vacations (with and without my kids), but I like to have some energetic ones too. Not every vacation should turn out exactly the same way. I like some variety in my life - though a few days off after we get home would be nice.

### It's Not Even Something I Can Do
I am not at 100% every day - and I never will be.

I have down days, just like everyone else. There are things I don't want to do sometimes. My energy and motivation will fluctuate.

I will get irritable and angry with my loved ones. I will need a break and I can't guarantee I'll have the energy to cook dinner and clean all the time.

I'll want to keep working when I need to rest. I'll be plagued by ideas I internalized throughout my life. I'll struggle to feel like I'm doing enough.

And that's okay.

### It’s About Rest, But It’s Really About Acceptance
I am where I am. I can't change that. I can only change the actions I take going forward.

This post is about rest, but really it's about acceptance. 

I need rest, but I would like to accept that it's not always cut and dry. Some days I will fight it. Some days I'll acknowledge it and take the breaks I need.

But I'm imperfect and always will be. That's okay.

Hi, I'm Stacie and I struggle with rest. You know, it feels good to get that off my chest.

I will probably always struggle with these things, but I absolutely see the benefits when I accept my body and its limitations and take a much-needed break. I love the feeling of contentment when I don't worry about ordering out because it's been a rough day. I love the skills I'm learning, and hopefully the lessons my kids are learning, when I lash out in anger but apologize after.

Because we're all imperfect and that's okay.

Rest is something beautiful and beneficial. It helps us do more and be better people, but it's not always easy - like everything in life. I can live with that.
