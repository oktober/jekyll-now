**Tutorial: How to Install Laravel 7 on VirtualBox VM Running Linux Mint 19**

Our next step is installing Composer and, finally, Laravel.

Let's get started.

## Install Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/){:target="_blank"} is a dependency management software. It will allow us to easily install Laravel and everything it needs.

1. Following the instructions at [getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/){:target="_blank"}
	- Copy their code
	- Paste it in terminal

	*Your code might look slightly different since you'll be installing a newer version of Composer. This should not cause any problems. **Make sure you copy the code from [Composer's download page](https://getcomposer.org/download/){:target="_blank"} to get the latest version**.*
	
	`php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
	php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'e5325b19b381bfd88ce90a5ddb7823406b2a38cff6bb704b0acc289a09c8128d4a8ce2bbafcd1fcbdc38666422fe2806') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
	php composer-setup.php
	php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"`

	![Terminal window with the Composer installer code](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/composer-1.png)

	- It will stop running on the last line, so press the Enter/Return key to finish it

2. To move the Composer file, run: `sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`

	![Terminal window with instructions to move composer.phar](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/composer-2.png)

3. To verify Composer is installed and running properly, run: `composer -v`
	- You should see something like this

## Install Laravel using Composer
Now that Composer is installed, we can finally install Laravel.

{:start="4"}
4. In terminal, run: `composer global require laravel/installer`

	*Depending on when you run this command, you might get a newer version of Laravel. At the time of this tutorial, 19.3 was the most recent version*

	- You should now see it installing Laravel, which can take some time

## Add Composer to $PATH
One last thing before we can use the `laravel` command - adding Composer's vendor bin directory to $PATH. This will tell the terminal where to find the info for the `laravel` command.

To do this, we'll be using a text editor called vi, which can be kind of tricky. 

**If you mess up or get lost anytime before Step 9**, do the following:
- Press the Esc key
- Type `:q!` to discard your changes and quit vi
- Try again from Step 5

*If you're still having issues, you could try nano instead (e.g. `sudo nano .bashrc`)*

{:start="5"}
5. To make sure you're in the home directory, run: `cd ~`
	- To open .bashrc with vi, run: `sudo vi .bashrc`
	- Enter your password if prompted

	![Terminal window with `sudo vi .bashrc`](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/PATH-1.png)

6. With the .bashrc file open
	- Type `G` (*make sure you hit the shift button first to make it a capital G*)
		- This will take you to the end of the file

	![Terminal window showing the contents of .bashrc at the end of the file](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/PATH-2.png)

7. Type `o` *(lower case o)* and press the Enter/Return key
	- This will give you 2 new lines. You are now in Insert Mode. Any characters you type will be entered into the file.

	![Terminal window showing 2 new lines at the end of .bashrc](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/PATH-3.png)

8. Enter the following at the end of the .bashrc file: `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin"`

	**Make sure everything is exactly the same**. Any difference means the `laravel` command probably won't work.

	![Terminal window showing the new line entered at the end of .bashrc](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/PATH-4.png)

9. Press the Esc key
	- Type `:wq` and press the Enter/Return key
		- This will save the text you entered and exit the file

	![Terminal window at the end of .bashrc with the command `:wq` at the bottom](/assets/images/laravel-on-mint-post/PATH-5.png)

	- You should now be back at the main terminal screen.

10. Close terminal and re-open it *(to save our changes)*

## Start Building Laravel Apps
Now you can navigate to your web directory

`cd /var/www/html`

And use 

`laravel new {name}` 
(*replace {name} with your app's name*)

to create a new Laravel app

## You Made It!

Well done sticking with it. Now go build some stuff!
