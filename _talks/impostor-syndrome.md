Do you ever feel like everyone else in the room is smarter than you? Do you consistently feel less qualified than your peers and feel like your success has just been a lucky break? Do you ever feel like you just don’t belong and, eventually, someone is going to find out you’re just a fraud? 

That’s Impostor Syndrome and you’ve got it. It affects practically everyone in some capacity and it is likely to be even worse if you’re in a social group that has negative stereotypes such as women & other underrepresented groups in STEM. 

Let’s talk about it. You’ll be surprised to find how many other people feel the same way and how it’s likely held them back from success in life and in work. Let’s discuss how it has affected us and how we can all work on managing this sometimes debilitating syndrome.
